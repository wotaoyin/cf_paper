\title{Response to the Two Reviewers}
\vspace{5mm}

We would like to thank the associate editor for the time and efforts in putting our manuscript through the review process. We would also like to thank the two anonymous referees for their carful reviews and constructive comments. The concerns of the reviewers have been addressed point by point. We are resubmitting the revised manuscript for review. 

Let us summarize the big changes in this new version:
\begin{itemize}
\item We corrected all of the typos based on the first reviewer's comments. 
\item We added convergence proof for coordinate friendly primal dual method. 
\item We added new numerical experiments to demonstrate the superior of coordinate friendly method over the start-of-the-art method. 
\end{itemize}
