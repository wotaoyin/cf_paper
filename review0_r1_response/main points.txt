*. strong performance of CU relies on solving simple subproblems (....) and CU quick convergence
*. we have rich results on CU convergence, but very little on problem structures amenable to CU
*. not all problem structures are amenable to CU; even if CU has fast convergence, it won't work when the subproblem is too difficult
*. existing CU only concentrates on a few albeit important classes of applications
*. for other problems, including very important ones, simple subproblems are not easy to identify! We don't have a measure (of how simple it needs to be) or tools to obtain them. The existing convergence-focused theory, as well as its kind to arrive in the future, does not provide these answers
*. the measure (of how simple it needs to be) must make sense and be simple to compute
*. the tools must be powerful to cover the current CU applications, as well as undiscovered ones
