\subsubsection{Nonnegative Matrix Factorization}
Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is an important dimension reduction method for nonnegative data. It was proposed by Paatero and his coworkers in \cite{paatero1994NMF}. Given a nonnegative matrix $A\in\RR^{p\times n}_+$, NMF aims at finding two nonnegative matrices $W\in\RR^{p\times r}_+$ and $H\in\RR^{n\times r}_+$ such that $WH^\top\approx A$, where $r$ is user-specified depending on the applications, and usually $r\ll \min(p,n)$. A widely used model is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nmf}
\begin{aligned}
&\Min_{W,H}F(W,H):=\frac{1}{2}\|WH^\top-A\|_F^2, \\
& \St\ W\in\RR^{p\times r}_+,\, H\in \RR^{n\times r}_+. 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Applying the projected gradient method \eqref{eq:proj-grad} to \eqref{eq:nmf}, we have
\begin{subequations}\label{pg-nmf}
\begin{align}
&W^{k+1}=\max\big(0, W^k-\eta_k \nabla_W F(W^k, H^k)\big),\\
&H^{k+1}=\max\big(0,H^k-\eta_k \nabla_H F(W^k, H^k) \big).
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
In general, we do not know the Lipschitz constant of $\nabla F$, so we have to choose $\eta_k$ by line search such that the Armijo condition is satisfied.

Partitioning the variables into $2r$ block coordinates: $(w_1, \ldots, w_r, h_1,\ldots, h_r)$, we can apply the coordinate update based on  projected-gradient method: 
\begin{subequations}\label{pcg-nmf}
\begin{align}\label{pcg-nmf-w}
&w_{i_k}^{k+1}=\max\big(0, w_{i_k}^k-\eta_k\nabla_{w_{i_k}} F(W^k, H^k)\big), &\text{ if } 1\le i_k\le r,\\
\label{pcg-nmf-h}
&h_{i_k-r}^{k+1}=\max\big(0, h_{i_k-r}^k-\eta_k \nabla_{h_{i_k-r}} F(W^k, H^k) \big), &\text{ if } r+1\le i_k\le 2r,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $i_k$ is the selected coordinate at the $k$-th iteration. It is easy to see that $\nabla_{w_i} F(W^k, H^k)$ and $\nabla_{h_i} F(W^k, H^k)$ are both Lipschitz continuous with constants $\|h_i^k\|_2^2$ and $\|w_i^k\|_2^2$ respectively. Hence, we can set 
$$\eta_k=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
\frac{1}{\|h_{i_k}^k\|_2^2},&\text{ if }1\le i_k\le r\\[0.1cm]
\frac{1}{\|w_{i_k-r}^k\|_2^2},&\text{ if }r+1\le i_k\le 2r.
\end{array}\right.$$
However, it is possible to have $w_i^k=0$ or $h_i^k=0$ for some $i$ and $k$, and thus the setting in the above formula may have trouble of being divided by zero. To overcome this problem, one can first modify the problem \eqref{eq:nmf} by restricting $W$ to have unit-norm columns and then apply the coordinate update method in \eqref{pcg-nmf}. Note that the modification does not change the optimal value since $WH^\top=(WD)(HD^{-1})^\top$ for any $r\times r$ invertible diagonal matrix $D$. We refer the readers to \cite{XY_2014_ecd} for more details.

Note that
$$\nabla_W F(W,H)= (WH^\top-A)H,\quad \nabla_H F(W,H)= (WH^\top-A)^\top W$$
and 
$$\nabla_{w_i} F(W,H)= (WH^\top-A)h_i,\quad \nabla_{h_i} F(W,H)= (WH^\top-A)^\top w_i,\, \forall i.$$
Therefore, the {coordinate updates given in \eqref{pcg-nmf} are computationally worthy (by maintaining the residual $W^k(H^k)^\top-A$).
