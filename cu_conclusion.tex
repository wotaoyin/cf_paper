\section{Conclusions}
We have presented a coordinate update method for fixed-point iterations, which updates one coordinate (or a few variables) at every iteration and can be applied to solve linear systems,\cut{ partial differential equations,} optimization problems, saddle point problems, variational inequalities, and so on. We proposed a new concept called CF operator. When an operator is CF, its coordinate update is computationally worthy and often preferable over the full update method, in particular in a parallel computing setting. We gave examples of CF operators and also discussed how the properties can be preserved by composing two or more such operators such as in operator splitting and primal-dual splitting schemes. In addition, we have developed CF algorithms for problems arising in several different areas including machine learning, imaging, finance, and distributed computing. Numerical experiments on portfolio optimization, CT imaging, and logistic regression have been provided to demonstrate the superiority of CF methods over their counterparts that update all coordinates at every iteration.
